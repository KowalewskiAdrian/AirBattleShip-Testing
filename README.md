Hello, 

This project is a testing project that was presented during the interview.
The project was a test to see a series of features including basic game mechanics design, design patterns, and pooling techniques.

To demonstrate the project's scalability, we applied the Interface class regardless of the game logic scale and also included a method of using a configuration file using ScriptableObject.

I also used a new method for the input event system to fit the characteristics of mobile games. And I implemented the gentle movement of the airship.

In UI processing, a UI using the MVC method using Action + Invoke was constructed according to the tester's request.

Anyway, since this project was written according to the tester's specific requirements, it cannot be perfect in all areas.

Thanks, Adrian.
